      I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon,_London">Wimbledon</a>, south London — home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon">The Championships</a> — and
      lived there for approximately 5 years before moving across the river to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastcote">Eastcote</a> where I lived, grew up and went to school (where my
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040717231151/http://education.independent.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=539986">year 11 ball</a> was featured in The Independent).

      At the end of 2003, I created my first website, wackomenace (named after
      I used one of the then-common ninja name generator websites), using a
      prepaid card (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031213005651/http://www.splashplastic.com/">Splash Plastic</a>) and a friendly web host that accepted it
      (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030210115238/http://www.purplecloud.com/">Purple Cloud</a>). It soon grew to include a blog, tools and resources as
      well as some of my first open-source code.

      I quickly got into the then popular "blog scene" featuring such
      luminaries as (in no particular order) <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt Haughey</a>, <a href="https://anildash.com/">Anil Dash</a>,
      <a href="https://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="https://kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a>, <a href="https://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a>, Mark Pilgrim, <a href="https://about.me/cam">Cameron Barrett</a>,
      <a href="http://daveshea.com/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="https://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="https://stopdesign.com/">Douglas Bowman</a>, <a href="https://waferbaby.com/">Daniel Bogan</a> and <a href="https://shauninman.com/pendium/">Shaun Inman</a>,
      amongst others, taking design and development cues as the web quickly
      evolved. I was even one of the <a href="https://kottke.org/about/patron/">kottke.org micropatrons</a> and Kickstarter
      backers for the reboot of <a href="https://upcoming.org/about/backers">Upcoming.org</a>.

      In 2006, I went to university at the <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/">University of Reading</a> where I got a
      degree in Computer Science. During that time, I worked for a year at
      the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mtc/locations?activetab=pivotregiongroup:primaryr5">Microsoft Technology Centre</a> in Reading.

      Around the end of 2008, wackomenace went offline as I migrated to more
      "respectable" domain names.

      My first job out of university was a Business Analyst at <a href="https://www.shell.co.uk/">Shell</a> on the
      graduate programme. I stayed with Shell for four-and-a-half years,
      working in a number of areas and it's also where I met my future wife</a>.

      During this time, I also ran TwentyFourNine, a small web development
      agency, on the side. I was even one of the sponsors of <a href="https://nine.barcamplondon.org/sponsors/">BarCamp London 9</a>.

      After this time, I decided that I wanted to get back into hands-on
      development and so left the comfort of a multinational company to
      move to <a href="https://www.orderswift.com/">orderswift</a>, a small startup working in online food ordering.
      It was a change of industry and a massive change of pace and
      responsibility, doing everything from web development to hardware
      installation and customer service. I stayed for a year, but probably
      learnt about five years worth in the time!

      I was looking for something a little different at this point, and
      happened to come across the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service</a>. I liked the
      organisation, their work and their ways of working, so when the
      opportunity arose, I said yes with little hesitation. I spent three
      years working on various parts of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>, and in that time moved up to
      eventually become Lead Developer. I also, for the first time, carried
      out and led interviews and became a line manager. I had an
      <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/03/how-we-use-instagram-at-gds/">Instagram story</a> made about my work and blogged about
      <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/24/what-do-we-mean-by-responsible-building/">the meaning of responsible building</a>. The work gave me a real sense of
      purpose and I loved every moment of it.

      In 2019, having decided to move from London to Cornwall with my wife,
      and remote working still being something that wasn't universally accepted,
      I left GDS and London, and started work at <a href="https://www.resolvergroup.com/">Resolver</a> as a Lead Developer,
      mostly remote but with three days a month in the office in London. I used
      to travel by train or plane and stay with my parents, but COVID-19 put an
      end to this regular commute. I worked on <a href="https://myresolutionhub.com/">My Resolution Hub</a> (previously
      Accord ODR), a new SaaS app aimed at dispute resolution providers. In
      addition, my wife and I took on the project management of our own
      self-build house from 2020.

      In April 2021, I moved to <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, where I worked as a Senior Backend
      Engineer, initially working on customer-facing analytics and latterly on
      experimental features for product growth. In May 2021, we moved to our
      newly-built house, and we’ve been finishing bits ever since.

      In July 2022, we bought our first puppy, <a href="https://saffy.dog/">Saffy</a>, a Portuguese Water Dog,
      and have been training her and managing a hyper dog ever since!

      In November 2022, along with a lot of others, I was made redundant from
      Hopin, and in December 2022, our daughter Evie was born. I took some
      involuntary time off to look after her for a few weeks.

      In January 2023, I started working as a Ruby contractor, and I currently
      work for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-product-safety-and-standards">Office for Product Safety and Standards</a>.

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <pre>
      This is the umpteenth iteration of my personal website. I've moved a
      number of times between hosting providers, technology stacks and having
      a blog versus a plain, low-maintenance landing page. You can find older
      iterations for my previous websites at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ruben.arakelyan.uk/*">ruben.arakelyan.uk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ruben.am/*">ruben.am</a>,
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ra.me.uk/*">ra.me.uk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120716070133/http://rubenarakelyan.com/">rubenarakelyan.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100207125823/http://www.rubenarakelyan.co.uk:80/vped">rubenarakelyan.co.uk</a> and
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120705022045/http://twentyfournine.co.uk/">twentyfournine.co.uk</a> at the Internet Archive. In addition, most old URLs
      should still work because <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URIs don't change</a>.

      I've deliberately kept this site as simple as possible with no bells
      or whistles. Just plain text.

      The current version of the site is created using <a href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a>, stored on <a href="https://github.com/rubenarakelyan/rubik.am">GitHub</a>
      and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
